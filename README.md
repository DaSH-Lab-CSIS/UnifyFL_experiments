# Experiment graph plots for UnifyFL
- Some graphs might not have legend, due to lack of space. Please refer to the twin graph ( accuracy <-> loss) for legend.
- Some graphs have extended plot past convergence, leading to time shown as higher than in the paper. Convergence time is taken as max(accuracy) or min(loss) in the paper.
