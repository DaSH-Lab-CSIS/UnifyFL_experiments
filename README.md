# Experiment graph plots for UnifyFL
- Some graphs might not have legend, due to lack of space. Please refer to the twin graph ( accuracy <-> loss) for legend.
- Some graphs have extended plot past convergence, leading to time shown as higher than in the paper. Convergence time is taken as the time for 50 rounds for imagenet and 100 rounds for cifar10.
